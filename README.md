# Sign prediction using GNN's

## Learnings from other papers:

1. Punish wrong classifications of negative links more, as they are usually less frequent. As seen in: Deep Network Embedding for Graph Representation Learning in Signed Networks
2. Use deep autoencoders to create vector embeddings. 


## Questions:

- Should I use edge embeddings or not?
